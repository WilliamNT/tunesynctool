# Contribution guidelines

- Follow the existing code formatting, documentation style.
- **Do not vibe code (use AI to code for you).** If I catch you, I won't accept your PR because I don't trust that you properly tested your modifications.
    - Using AI for autocompletion, searching for (potential) bugs, receiving advice is fine as long as it is obvious you know what you are doing and it is solely used to assist your existing skillset.
- Always test your changes before opening a pull request.
